# Gameplay Project
This project is an adventure game I've created using Unreal Engine 4 C++, aimed at demonstrating various gameplay mechanics. I've included my commented source code in this repository, and the project can be downloaded from my itch.io profile at https://shravani.itch.io/action-adventure-game.

## Summary of Features
Features I've implemented so far:
- Character — includes user input, controls, camera input, and animations. 
- Enemies — programmed to move towards the player and attack when in range, and display enemy health bars.
- Combat — melee combat is implemented in this game, along with damage and death functionality, as well as hit sounds and hit particles.
- Gameplay mechanics — the level contains pickups and hazards for the player to interact with, a weapon that can be equipped, floating platforms, a floor switch that opens a door when stepped on, enemy spawn volumes, and level transition volumes (two maps are currently included in the game).
- HUD — health, stamina, and coin count functionality and widgets are included, and also a pause menu with save/load functionality.  

## Project Demos
Since the packaged game is too large to be uploaded here, I've included two short gameplay videos:
- Demo_1 shows character and camera control, as well as stamina bar functionality, and how the stamina depletes and replenishes as the character sprints. 
- Demo_2 shows the character interacting with floating platforms (I'll try to improve lighting in future videos!), then a floor switch that opens a door leading to a level transition. In the second map, other gameplay mechanics are shown, such as pickups and hazards, weapon equipping, and enemy combat.

## Upcoming Updates
Here are some issues/features I'm currently working on and will post updates soon:
- Saving and loading currently has a few issues (starting a new game and transitioning to another map sometimes has incorrect weapon equipping).
- Enemy health bar does not always appear.
- Combat is currently limited and can be improved upon, giving the player more control over attacking and dealing with multiple enemies.
- UE4 files will be uploaded soon, including the blueprints I've created and the .uproject file. 
- Overall, level design (among other features) can be improved for a fun gaming experience.

Stay tuned for more!
